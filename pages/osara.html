 <p>oSARA analyzes the AndroidManifest.xml file associated with Android code repositories to capture the history
            of all permission changes. The motivation for building this tool was to understand the types of users that
            make permission changes to apps, how frequently the permissions are added and reverted and when in the app's
            commit history the changes are made.</p>

            <p>The source code for the tool is available <a href="https://github.com/MobileEvolution/oSARA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    
        <h3>Setup and Running</h3>
        <p>
        The tool was developed as a Windows Form Application using Visual Studio 2017. It utilizes F-Droid's collection
        of open source Android code repositories to perform the analysis on. Presently, the tool targets repositories
        hosted on GitHub.

        To run the tool, either:

        <ol>
        <li>clone/download the GitHub repository. Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project</li>
        <li>extract the files from the executable.zip archive and run 'AndroidCodeAnalyzer.exe'</li>
        </ol>
            It is recommend that the following sequence be followed when running the tool:
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#sc_02">F-Droid Repository</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#sc_03">Download Android Projects</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#sc_04">Get Project Commit History</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#sc_05">Get Manifest History</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#sc_06">Process Author Rating</a> </li>
            <li><a href="#sc_07">Process Permissions</a> </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Screens</h3>
        <h5 id="sc_01"><u>Main/Home Screen</u></h5>
        The following is the main/home screen of the tool. From this screen, the user can perform the required download/processing tasks.
