    <h2>Investigating Permission Issues in Open-source Android Apps</h2>

    <p>
Permissions are one of the most fundamental components for protecting
an Android user’s privacy and security. Unfortunately,
developers frequently misuse permissions by requiring too many
or too few permissions, or by not adhering to permission best
practices. These permission-related issues can negatively impact
users in a variety of ways, ranging from a poor user experience
to severe privacy and security implications. To better understand
permission-related issues during the app’s development process,
we conduct an empirical study of 574 GitHub repositories of opensource
Android apps. We analyze the occurrences of four types of
permission-related issues across the lifetime of the apps.

Our findings reveal that (i) permission-related issues are a frequent phenomenon in Android apps, (ii) the majority of issues are fixed in a timespan of a few weeks after their introduction, (iii) in many cases, permission-related issues can linger inside an app for an extended period of time, that can be as high as several years, before being fixed, and (iv) developers tend to introduce and fix permission-related issues independently of their experience within the project, but developers with more than 2 years of experience tend to introduce and fix under-permission issues more. This study benefits both researchers and developers to better understand the phenomenon of permission-related issues in Android apps and in better planning their development activities (e.g. planning refactoring sessions or assigning code reviews).
